# Comparative Analysis of CNN and RNN Models for Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code and a Jupyter Notebook for sentiment analysis comparison between CNN and RNN models. The project utilizes the Sentiment140 dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/).

The dataset should be downloaded and place into a directory named `Sentiment140` in this repository.
